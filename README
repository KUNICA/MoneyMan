You control a smiley which has to collect coins.
Play in two modes - speed mode: collect the coins and thereby unlock the
exit door and reach it.
or time mode: collect as many coins as possible in a given amount of time.
The game supports highscores in single player mode.

In 2 Player mode you have both modes available. In time mode the player
who gets more coins in the given time, gets a point.
In speed mode the player gets the point who got more coins and reaches
the exit first. All other situations end as draw.

You can set the number of coins, the interval between the relocations
and the time in the time mode to improve your game experience.

Have fun!
